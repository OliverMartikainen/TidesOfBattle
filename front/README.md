# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.

# TODO
1. fix bug --> select 1, refresh page, other selects 2nd --> lose all vision 
	- same if you refresh, then select as 2nd. person --> quickly resets your view
	- SSE stuff, const initThing is called somewhere in const CardSubHandler

2. mlgHorn --> so that it plays for everyone (then can silence their own phones --> or talk with aleksi how we want it)
	- only want to play if its on of the final cards --> so for swordPlayer, need to check order
	- Update db so that order is known?
	- mobile chrome browser --> no sound...

3. test that shit works in browser too
	- turns screen of, then resume, see if still works


4. what happens if you still in old state and new old state is created? 
eg still in old view, new set is played till the end so new old state is created
- i think its fine?

5. FIX MOBILE CONTAINER & SIZES
